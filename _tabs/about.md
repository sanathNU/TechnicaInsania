## Intro
Namaste Netizens! I'm  Sanath! I'm a Computer Engineer from Bangalore! I like meddling and technology and building some cool stuff! This blog contains the essense of what I should consider my "internet personality". I would like this to be a place where I can pen posts about captivating topics in technology, science, books and movies. This is a free flowing blog, so I'll be putting out posts haphazardly, with no rhyme or reason for the thoughts, at least in this initial years. I'll write a post regarding how my creative process is..

## Topics of Interest
I like a lot of topics, mostly ranging in the "cool-tech-gen-Z-guy" spectrum. It ranges from Sci-Fi to philosophy, to movies, to historical geopolitics. 
TODO: More detailed explanation (lol xD)
