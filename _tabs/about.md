## Intro
Namaste Netizens! I'm Sanath, and I love tinkering with technology and building cool stuff. This website represents my "internet personality" - a space where I can explore and share thoughts about technology, science, books, and movies. <br>
Think of this as my digital notebook, where I'll be documenting ideas and observations as they come. While the posts might be a bit haphazard initially, they'll offer an honest glimpse into the mind of a curious technologist finding his way through the digital age.

## Topics of Interest
I like a lot of topics, mostly ranging in the "tech-savvy Gen-Z" spectrum. It ranges from Sci-Fi to philosophy, to movies, to historical geopolitics. I'm curious about technology and how it affects the real world, sci-fi and how it shapes technology, culture and how it influences sci-fi, and culture as an original driving force in society.

## About the Website Icon
The image was created using [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) with simple prompts. 

I know that as we move further from 2021 - the year when DALL-E and Generative AI entered public consciousness (though they existed long before) - the novelty of this new type of AI generated images will die.<br>
Yet I choose to keep this image, or perhaps replace it with another AI-generated one, because it represents something remarkable to me: how mathematics and algorithms can create images that seem to emerge directly from human imagination. It's the power of neural networks at our fingertips - though unlike certain ambitious scientists with mechanical arms, we're using this power rather more responsibly.
It makes me reflect on how the line between  flesh and fabrication is growing increasingly thin. This image stands as my personal acknowledgment of our entry into the 'Age of Silicon.'

And yes, it comes with [free licensing](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license). As long as I avoid anything illegal, creepy, or harmful to the community, I'm free to use these images. This aligns perfectly with my belief in open-source.(I endorse you Richard Stallman!ðŸ˜‚)
