## Intro
Namaste Netizens! I'm  Sanath! I like meddling and technology and building some cool stuff! This blog contains the essense of what I should consider my "internet personality". I would like this to be a place where I can pen posts about captivating topics in technology, science, books and movies.<br>
This is a free flowing notebook, so I'll be putting out posts haphazardly, with no rhyme or reason for the thoughts, at least in this initial years. I don't want to come off as a self-assured pseudo-intellectual, but rather to offer a glimpse into the raw thoughts of a young man. I'll write a post regarding how the working of my creative process is.

## Topics of Interest
I like a lot of topics, mostly ranging in the "cool-tech-gen-Z-guy" spectrum. It ranges from Sci-Fi to philosophy, to movies, to historical geopolitics. I like to talk about technology and how it effects the real world, sci-fi and how it affects technology, culture and how it effects sci-fi, and culture as a force on it's own.

## About the Website Icon
The image is created from [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/). From simple prompts. 
I know as the years pass on from 2021 (the year of advent of DALL-E and Generative AI in public perception, even though they were present way earlier), the novelty of this new type of AI generated images will die.<br>
But I still will keep this image as it is, or replace with another AI generated image, because it simply is wonderful to me, how math and algorithms can create an image that looks like straight out of a human's mind. <br>
It inspires a thought in me about how the age of differentiaton between the thinking of  Man and Machine are coming to an end. It's a symbolic representation of my acknowledgement that the dawn of the 'Age of Silicon' is upon us. <br>
Also, it's [free licensing](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CompVis/stable-diffusion-license) lol. Unless I seriously do something illegal, or creepy, or something to upset the community, I can use these images.  It also gels with my concept of open source media.
