Here lies resources that I found useful over the years. Will try to organize them into a much more coherant set. Others will be kept at a seperate place in my Github! (TODO: Create a 'bookmarks' repo)
(TODO: Write an essay on andy's notes on why ['collecting material feels more useful than it usually is'](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQm6XAB3XXrXLHzF7gahpJ2))
If you want to look at a previous iteration of mine, you can look at [my previous website](https://github.com/sanathNU/Website-For-Cool-Websites), where I have given links to some of the resources that excited me at that time. Mind you that that repo isn't currently maintainedðŸ˜…, so some of the links might be broken. Will fix it in the future!
