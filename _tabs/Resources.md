Here lies resources that I found useful over the years. Will try to organize them into a much more coherant set. Others will be kept at a seperate place in my GitHub! <br>

<!-- (TODO: Write an essay on andy's notes on why ['collecting material feels more useful than it usually is'](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zQm6XAB3XXrXLHzF7gahpJ2)) <br> -->

If you want to look at a previous iteration of mine, you can look at [my previous website](https://sanathnu.github.io/Website-For-Cool-Websites/), where I have given links to some of the resources that excited me at that time. Mind you that that repo isn't currently maintainedðŸ˜…, so some of the links might be broken. Will fix it in the future!

### Philosophy

Like many of tech peeps out there, I like sharing links and articles and resources that I found helpful (and also things that I "think" I would have found useful ðŸ™ƒ). But whatever is free, should be used by most number of poeple. Knowledge is power and hence I would like to help other people on the internet, similar to how I was (and still am) being helped by the people of the internet.

### Order

- There are a lot of links that need a lot of be sorted and put out here. So, I'm thinking order by major sciences, then individual niche topics maybe. It all depends on how interesting I have visited the websites and have found helpful. I gotta be honest here, I don't visit half the websites I see here, but again, there's no harm in 'links hoarding' xD.
- So, I'm dividing them into Ordered and Unordered

#### Unordered Links
