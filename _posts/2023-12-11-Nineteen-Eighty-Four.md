## Introduction
A dark view of a dystopian society, a world so terrible, where terror has become the norm. A famous adaptation of the [George Orwell's 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four), which received positive reviews when it was released. It also had a little bit of clout because [Richard Burton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton) (I have no clue who this guy isðŸ˜‚) was present in it. 

I found this movie personally, very enjoyable. I had read the [famous book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) earlier and was looking online to figure out whether good adaptations of this movie exists, when I stumbled onto it. Here, I'm going to do a comparison of how I found the movie compared to the book, and my ideas regarding it. Of course, there are going to be spoilers, but do come back after seeing the movie!

My basic information about the happenings surrounding the movie (director, music) all come from Wikipedia (yeah, I know, I'm lazy). This is not meant to be comprehensive deconstruction of a hyped trope movie, but a general analysis by a normie who read the book.

## General Thoughts
The movie is faithfully adapted to the book. The concepts of [doublethink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink), [NewSpeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) are clearly depicted. Even the girl who played Julia seemed nice enough. But I think to firmly believe that to understand the concepts and the world built behind it and the ideas represented in the book, one should have already read the book.

The main thing, that caught my attention in this movie was the OST. It was really beautiful to hear some ideas that were so accurately described. I mean, it tries to touch into the soul of what Winston was feeling. Hence it's ethereal nature is very...appeasing to the ears. It's interesting to read that there was a [there was a controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_(1984_film)#Score_controversy) over it. But apart form that, the the music gels very well with the dream sequences, which I loved in the movie. It's better than what I imagined in the book.

It's a scary book, if you think of it that way, a dark world where human emotions are clamped the darker version of a organization. The imposistion and limitations on the human will presented here is crazy.
