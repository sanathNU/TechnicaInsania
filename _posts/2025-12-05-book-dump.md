## Intro
I’ve decided to move all my book reviews into the open. At some point this year it clicked that the internet is basically a giant sorting hat now, and only the loudest, most optimized content gets any attention. Anything written by a "normie" person just disappears, and I’m not pretending I’m getting sorted into “top content.” That is fine. The void and I get along.

I also accepted that anonymity is gone. I have leaked enough linguistic entropy across the web that anyone with a half decent embeddings model could sketch out my personality.[^1] Weirdly, that made things simpler. I do not need a Substack. I do not need engagement. The trail is already out there.


So I’m just dumping everything. Notes, half formed thoughts, all the book stuff I’ve been hoarding. Not to build an audience, just because it is easier to externalize my brain than to pretend I’m saving it for some imaginary later.

It will be somewhat organized. It will make me revisit old ideas. Maybe even fun. Let’s see how far I get.
