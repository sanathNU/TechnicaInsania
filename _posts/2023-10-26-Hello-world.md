#### Introduction
Hello, welcome to my 'digital room'. Here lies my rants about technology, science and current culture. I would like to categorize myself as the average Joe of the internet. I just like to learn about stuff and spit out the same shit here. I am NOT original in any sense.This is just one of my attempts to scream into the void. This is NOT a technical blog. I'll try attempting to chart my journey of figuring out what to write and how should this website function

#### The Search for the Beginning
So, while constructing this website. I was looking for inspiration and saw a lot of websites and topics and methods. Some of them were out of bounds and some of them were interesting. There are just so many ways of expressing yourself!<br>
While Twitter seems to be the obvious choce for micro-blogging peeps, who'd announce every fart that have in a day, I think my thoughts should be more coherent and a bit drawn out.
I was exposed to a loto f topics like [digital gardens](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), curated blogs, and many more things. Some were  fascinating people, whose thoughts you could go on reading forever. There's a kind of intellectual titillation I feel when I go through these websites. These people, boldly declare to the world, "I existed for this time in the world ! I found this cool shit! ".  Unlike the historic handprints (TODO: Add link here) in the cave, which is a footprint of huamnity's art, these websites also serve as a reminder of the existence of a person.<br>
 I felt that I should contribute on this scale.
As interesting as these were, I felt something... was missing. A something that would only be filled by me. Something, that wasn't SEO optimized, crowd-attracting bullshit. 
I realized that I didn't want this to be a blog, or a portfolio looking kinda shit. I wanted this to scream me. A weird offputting connection of words that made no sense, but only in the wackiest way possible.

#### A grand realization

#### The Promized Website
