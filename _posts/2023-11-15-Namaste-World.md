## Introduction
Hello, welcome to my 'digital room'. Here lies my rants about technology, science and current culture. I would like to categorize myself as the average Joe of the internet. I just like to learn about stuff and spit out the same shit here. I am NOT original in any sense.This is just one of my attempts to scream into the void. This is NOT a technical blog. This 'writing' thing is something that I want to nurture on the side.

## Why this?
Unlike most of humanity's history. There never was a place for expression of thoughts and ideas expect for media and personal notes. Most of the 'mass of men' (as quoted by Thoreau) didn't have any idea of expression of ideas. But the Internet, a vast expanse of digitally connected immortal machines which transfer huge loads of data, gave an opportunity for people to express themselves and find their niche community online. <br>
I too want to enter the same domain. Not because I want to find fame or anything, but as an expression of oneself. Yeah sure the "armchair psychologists" might point out the hypocrisy on this point by making a blog post...but I dunno man, I'm trying to be real here. Rather like how we take photos to remind ourselves of our past looks, this is similar to how I would like to look at my past thoughts. <br>
If I'm being completely honest, I'm not the best writer ðŸ˜… (who am I kidding here...with my "dunno" and "kinda") nor have a great internet personality. I feel like, if there was ever a 'YouTube for Blogs' (I dunno, isn't this what [Medium](https://medium.com/) is?), I would be some kind of low-tier 'Blogtuber' with 10k subscribersðŸ˜‚.

## Previously, on IdioticRamblings
I wrote previously [here](https://iditoicramblings.blogspot.com/) mostly about thoughts from movies I watched or showerthoughts. It was raw and unstructured. But it was fun, because I literally gave them 10 mins worth of time to do that stuff. It was much more personal and non-technical.

If you like to spend like half an hour reading the rants of a young (and stupid might I add) vicenarian, you can go there. In my retrospective honest opinion, the posts there are more like an attempt to experience the feelings that I had during that time.

## Why this, Part 2
While writing this, I came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x6SCSz7g5I) on YouTube, where this guy discusses some interesting points. He discusses websites where he could spend hours, picking through the brain of the author.
I want this website to serve the same purpose. Look at [this guy](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/). He has a mind-numbing amount of thoughts, so much, that I moneteized it ðŸ˜‚. I hope not to monetize...whatever this is... in the future, but to have notes and thoughts with the same intensity as this guy. This should serve as a repository of thoughts: good, bad, neutral, stupid and clever.

## Caveats
* I am DEFINITELY NOT a writer. I just write this kind of stuff for the sake of my own satisfaction.
* In the infinite depths of the internet, you'd find every kind of person trying to promulgate knowledge, trying to make money and/or gathering an audience. This is not what I want. This is just a chilling place for my humble self.
* These views are mine and mine alone. These are not carefully constructed views of the world, but are random points that I find interesting and have an interest in sharing with the world.
