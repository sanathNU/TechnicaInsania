## Introduction

Stocism, the granddaddy of all alpha sigma style thinking , is making rounds of trending news in the past few years. The Idea of the stoic man, calm and unabased under the most tense and terse circumstances has been a goal of many of these internet celebrities. 


### Points to talk about
* Your social life is your own and no one else's. 
* It's how you behave that shapes how your social life is. A social stoic, behaves the best he can under the circumstances he is in. He leaves a toxic relationship or a friendhips that is not helpful to his own self.
* He develops shells of understanding or 'fortressess' in his social standing where people can stay and leave. The more intimate they get, the more levels of consciousness are allowed.
