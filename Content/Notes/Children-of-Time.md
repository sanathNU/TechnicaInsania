# Children of Time
*Running thoughts while reading. Preserved exactly as chaotic as intended.*  
*Feb–Mar 2025*  

## **Initial Impressions**
**21-02-2025**  
- Needed a story to get out of my brain, man. This one did the job.  
- Fast pacing, clear visuals, and yeah, spiders taking over is a weirdly fun concept.  
- The ecosystem-worldbuilding behind each scene is tight.  
- The two-timeline structure + the “crystallised species control” concept is cool. High-concept fiction, fun to think about.

## **Midway Thoughts**
**23-02-2025**  
- This is a very “show-like” book lol. Might have binge watched it overnight be excited about this. 
- Themes of gender equity and violence in the spider world (mirroring the real world?).  
- Civilization growth arcs are genuinely entertaining.  
- The whole serum discovery and virus-analysis part felt way too quick. Breakthroughs don’t happen in three weeks lol, but fine. We roll with it.


## **Final Thoughts**
**26-02-2025**  
- Book done. La-di-da man. Pretty solid ending.  
- Character development? Surprisingly good. Lain and Guyen have great arcs.  
- This book is about *going* places, not about engineering those places. And that’s fine.  
- Not much in terms of “hard-hard science.” It’s running with tropes, and it works.  
- Tight storyline. Characters make clear decisions. Respect.

### **Worldbuilding & Alien POV**
- Loved the shifting spider societies: castes, virus-level differences, land vs water civilizations. The intergenerational startship applied to both the spaceship and the planet eh?
- Alien POV reminded me of [*The Dark Forest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest): a perspective so unfamiliar it makes your brain hurt (in a good way).  
- Spiders boarding the Gilgamesh and getting confused by right angles? Peak alien-geometry moment. Same vibe as the vampires in *Blindsight*.  
- Goethe had it nailed:  
  **“Music is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music.”**

### **Science Gripes (aka the Fun Bits)**
- A ship designed to last 2,000 years being defeated by spiders with acid? Come on bro.  
- The prisoner’s dilemma reference was cool, but… **language exists.** Negotiate! Stall! Go hide behind a moon! Anything except “let’s just blow up the ship.”  
- Ant-colony-optimization-as-brain? Not buying it. Delays kill it. Bandwidth kills it. Physical scale kills it.  
- They completely ignore communication delay too.  
- But whatever — writing sci-fi is hard. Salute.

## **P.S.**
This book made me want more sci-fi that genuinely commits to alien cognition. Not “humans with exoskeletons,” but **real** alien minds that force you to rethink your own assumptions.

## **P.P.S.**
If I ever write sci-fi, I want the alien POV to feel as geometry-warping as spiders seeing right angles for the first time.
