# Books of 2023: A Hindsight

## Introduction

This is literally just a list from my goodreads page, just a little bit extra juice on which books I liked most. Some had interesting impacts. Some were your regular old jelly. They didn't excite this raw flesh between my skull bones. It's been an intersting year of learning, another interesting year of reflection. I thank thee, oh randomness lord to help me be sorted for all these days to come.
