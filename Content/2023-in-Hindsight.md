# Books of 2023: A Hindsight

## Introduction

This is a quick recap of the books I read in 2023. I won’t cover every book, just the ones that really caught my interest and taught me something new. Think of it as a kind of mental exercise to see how my understanding has evolved. I’ll include some of my personal notes from last year, with parts quoted verbatim, to highlight key points and track any shifts in my mindset.

I think this is like my meta review of the books that I read in 2023. Things that I want to remember from some of the books. I can't believe it's already been like a year though. The passing perception of time is perplexing. Also, this is written in 2024. The time jump is not great, but yeah. It helps me reflect.

### Brave New World

When I first read this book, I didn't think much of it. It was the **FIRST** book, one I "reviewed" reviewed, so I went all in. Still, it didn’t exactly "[blow my hair back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25ev8pvUpKs)".
Regarding the author itself, I see that [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson) is like a very popular author, but at the time I didn't know it. I recently read [The Undercover Economist](https://timharford.com/books/undercovereconomist/) and there he mentioned that the former was a brillant biologist, and a superior economist too. Well, this has prompted me to look more into his book. Let's see. I remember this dude stressing on how the sciences and humanities should be "together", sciences will help us power the new future, humanities will help make sense of it.
The author emphasized that sciences and humanities should be united: sciences will drive the future forward, while humanities will help us make sense of it. I also recall an intriguing idea from the book's summary, about preserving biological human nature as a sacred trust and being cautious with genetic manipulation. That’s a perspective I hadn’t really thought about before—being human as an art form, a unique species in its own right.So, yeah. That's about it. Good number of quotes I felt.
