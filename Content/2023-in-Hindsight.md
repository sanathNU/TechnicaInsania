# Books of 2023: A Hindsight
##  Introduction
This is a quick recap of the books I read in 2023. I won’t cover every book, just the ones that really caught my interest and taught me something new. Think of it as a kind of mental exercise to see how my understanding has evolved. I’ll include some of my personal notes from last year, with parts quoted verbatim, to highlight key points and track any shifts in my mindset.

> This part is still in progress, as I'll be adding the books and revising the views on it.
