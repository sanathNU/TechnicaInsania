## Introduction

So, this has been a point of serious contemplation for me from a long time. Earlier, when I was in my early teens, I used to read a lot of books. Fiction and crime thrillers mostly. [Dan Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown), [Sidney Sheldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Sheldon), [Rich Riordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Riordan)(I used to read him waay before these people got famous lol).These used to spark off my ideas and thinking. I thought that maybe I could be creative enough to write books someday. I even wrote some, but in retrospect it's mostly shit. It can be well summarized by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKXDUBqdrxE).<br>
I was so fascinated with science fiction and idea the creative worlds can be conjured by these "wizards of words". But as I grew up, I saw that I was not cut out for writing words and stories. I was not interested in the creation of creative stories. 

### More ideas
* You want the world to know about some of your mediocre ideas. Not scientifically acurate or something, but mostly just ramblings of a guy
* These writings might be erratic and non-chalant. As most blogs are in the interent, I do not want to post some random posts for a year and then go silent for entirety. I would like to curate this website for how much time, I can putting the most randomest of content online for the whole world to see. A glimpse in the innards of a growing guy.
