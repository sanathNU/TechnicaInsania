## Introduction

Well, well well, here we are. I welcome you on this journey, reader to figure out why I do write and why This isn't going to be some serious contemplation the history of my failures and my struggles as a writer (I'm not a serious writer lol). But again, it's a much more unrefined version of why I do what I do, currently (i.e 2024) and how it's going to change in the future. <br>
I'm not a really good writer per se, to write whatever claim to be writing this page. But this is just an attempt to speak my mind, in the way why I write.

## History

Earlier, when I was in my early teens, I used to read a lot of books. Fiction and crime thrillers mostly. [Dan Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown), [Sidney Sheldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Sheldon), [Rich Riordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Riordan)(I used to read him waay before these people got famous lol) and many others were my goto novelists .These used to spark off my ideas and thinking. I thought that maybe I could be creative enough to write books someday. I even wrote some, but in retrospect it's mostly shit. It can be well summarized by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKXDUBqdrxE).<br>

I was so fascinated with science fiction and idea that creative worlds can be conjured by these "wizards of words". But as I entered high school, I saw that I was not cut out for writing words and stories. I was not interested in the creation of creative stories. I was a consumer of content rather than a creator. I gave up on writing my own stories and just forgot the concept of writing.

  
  

### More ideas

* You want the world to know about some of your mediocre ideas. Not scientifically acurate or something, but mostly just ramblings of a guy

* These writings might be erratic and non-chalant. As most blogs are in the interent, I do not want to post some random posts for a year and then go silent for entirety. I would like to curate this website for how much time, I can putting the most randomest of content online for the whole world to see. A glimpse in the innards of a growing guy.
