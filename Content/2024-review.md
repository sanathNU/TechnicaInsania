# Books of 2024
Well, there has been a fair amount of reading in 2024, and this is my review of it. I've read some painfully dull books, and some that lit my brain on fire. This year, certain genres hit something deep inside me - like an internal bell that vibrates through your mind when an idea really strikes home. That bell rang many times this year, and it was awesome.

Through these pages, I wandered through science, philosophy, history, economics, and political science. Along the way, I learned something uncomfortable: everything you read, everything you think... it's all temporary. Books that seemed life-changing last year barely left a scratch this year (except for that newfound skepticism). The futility of reading hit me hard. I kept asking myself "why push yourself?" Why this constant drive to learn and update yourself?
Living in this technological rocket-ride of an era, I watch thoughts slip away into the vast space created by our growing network of knowledge. But here's the thing: I believe we have an obligation - to this mind we've been given, to push it to its fullest potential. To truly try to grasp the breadth of human experience. And for me, that happens through books.

The books I encountered this year carved a clear intellectual path - through science, economics, and power. This piece is my attempt to map that journey. The books that rocked my world, the ideas that shifted my thinking, and the thoughts that emerged along the way.

#### The Ride down brain
I started 2024 armed with "Thinking, Fast and Slow," all ready to rewire my brain with good paradigms. Before I could get too comfortable with cognitive biases,The Three Body Problem trilogy came out of nowhere and hit me like a truck. Complex intra-planet instantenous communication through Quantum particle-supercomputer? Get outta here. I'm going all in. I think Roger Penrose's ideas on computers and conscisouness is something to be kept in mind of. It was a hard read, but I was exposed to a lot of ideas. It was fun. Bullshit Jobs turned out to be a dud. But the author's highly regarded? I don't know, I moved on.
Guns, Germs and Steel, a book that was on my shelf for so long...didn't disappoint. Although I found the details on cultures...a little dry, and the fact that t
Suddenly I'm learning about genocidal cultures and why Australia is basically life on hard mode. Did you know the Fertile Crescent didn't stay fertile? Mind blown.

# Quotations of the year
### History
* The book Oriental Heritage alone deserves a section. It's that good.

> Some day, perhaps, these chattering quadrupeds, these ingratiating centipedes, these insinuating bacilli, will devour man and all his works, and free the planet from this marauding biped, these mysterious and unnatural weapons, these careless feet!

> “My two main conclusions are that technology develops cumulatively, rather than in isolated heroic acts, and that it finds most of its uses after it has been invented, rather than being invented to meet a foreseen need.” 
>  - Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and Steel

>  Property was the mother, war was the father, of the state.

> The institutions, conventions, customs and laws that make up the complex structure of a society are the work of a hundred centuries and a billion minds; and one mind must not expect to comprehend them in one lifetime, much less in twenty years.

> The king dies, but the bureaucracy is immortal.

> The superstitions of Babylonia seem ridiculous to us, because they differ superficially from our own. There is hardly an absurdity of the past that cannot be found flourishing somewhere in the present. Underneath all civilization, ancient or modern, moved and still moves a sea of magic, superstition and sorcery. Perhaps they will remain when the works of our reason have passed away.

> For barbarism is always around civilization, amid it and beneath it, ready to engulf it by arms, or mass migration, or unchecked fertility. Barbarism is like the jungle; it never admits its defeat; it waits patiently for centuries to recover the territory it has lost.
