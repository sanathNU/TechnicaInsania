# Books of 2024
Well, there has been a fair amount of reading in 2024, and this is my review of it. I've read some painfully dull books, and some that lit my brain on fire. This year, certain genres hit something deep inside me - like an internal bell that vibrates through your mind when an idea really strikes home. That bell rang many times this year, and it was awesome.


Through these pages, I wandered through science, philosophy, history, economics, and political science. Along the way, I learned something uncomfortable: everything you read, everything you think... it's all temporary. Books that seemed life-changing last year barely left a scratch this year (except for that newfound skepticism). The futility of reading hit me hard. I kept asking myself "why push yourself?" Why this constant drive to learn and update yourself?


Living in this technological rocket-ride of an era, I watch thoughts slip away into the vast space created by our growing network of knowledge. But here's the thing: I believe we have an obligation - to this mind we've been given, to push it to its fullest potential. To truly try to grasp the breadth of human experience. And for me, that happens through books.This piece is my attempt to map that journey. The books that rocked my world, the ideas that shifted my thinking, and the thoughts that emerged along the way.

#### The Scientific Foundation

I started 2024 armed with "Thinking, Fast and Slow," all ready to rewire my brain with good paradigms. Before I could get too comfortable with cognitive biases,The Three Body Problem trilogy came out of nowhere and hit me like a truck. Complex intra-planet instantaneous communication through Quantum particle-supercomputer? Multi-planetary System organisational problems? Alternative speculative technologies for [FLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light)? Get outta here. I went all in and it was very satisfying end I must say.

  

I think Roger Penrose's ideas on computers and consciousness is something to be kept in mind of. It was a hard read, but I was exposed to a lot of ideas. It was fun. Bullshit Jobs turned out to be a dud. But the author's highly regarded? I don't know, I moved on.

Guns, Germs and Steel; a book that was on my shelf for so long...didn't disappoint. Although I found the details on cultures...a little dry, and the fact that there is so much more to know...so many patterns, so many incidents, it just blows you away you know. I was exploring our very old [DJ Peach Cobbler](https://www.youtube.com/@DJPeachCobbler) and his ideas on the Aztecs and Spanish Inquisition, and it started a whole lot of history tour for me lol. Pretty fun

  

Suddenly I'm learning about genocidal cultures and why Australia is basically life on hard mode. Did you know the Fertile Crescent [didn't stay fertile](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4p4qt7/why_is_the_fertile_crescent_now_desert/)? Mind blown man.

  

#### Economic Awakening
But then came "Who Owns the Future" - holy hell. I was dealing with some heavy family stuff back home when I picked this up, and somehow that made its ideas hit even harder. It is interesting and inspiring because it makes you think outside not only your box, but whatever notion of the world you have. I know, sometimes authors are pretentious, but this guy was good for my brain. He taught me a lot of things.
