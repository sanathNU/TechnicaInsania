### What is this?
A place for hosting a blog regarding technology, science and art. This was create with the help of [Chirpy Jekyll Blog](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). Here lies the ramblings of a technophile and a passionate reader!

### Meaning of the name
Technica Insania can be faithfully translated into Latin as 'Technical Insanity.' While this rendition may not entirely be truthful of the blog's content, it certainly embodies the fervor with which I aspire to express my thoughts online.

### Work in progress
This blog is still a work in progress, by which I need to change a lot of layout and customize it such that I feel comfortable writing in it. So Keep on holding! Again I'm not a front-end dev, so I don't care much about apperance xD.
