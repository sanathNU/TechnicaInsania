### What is this?
A place for hosting a blog regarding technology, science and art. This was create with the help of [Chirpy Jekyll Blog](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). Here lies the ramblings of a technophile and a passionate reader!
Also, this is not a fluid thought process oriented blog, but kind of a digital garden? I think it might help to think , that this is an extension of my internt self and what I find intellecutually invigorating and aesthetic.

### Meaning of the name
Technica Insania can be faithfully translated into Latin as 'Technical Insanity.' While this rendition may not entirely be truthful of the blog's content, it certainly embodies the fervor with which I aspire to express my thoughts online.
